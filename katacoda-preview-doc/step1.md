The first step is to fork a documentation repository.

Here you are going to clone the template repository.site

For your own use case, you will have to clone your own doc repository.

But for this demo we will only clone the template one in this playground.

## Task

Clone our template repository that contains the template documentation with the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/ConsenSys/doctools.template-site.git template-docsite`{{execute}}s
